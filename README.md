# Find A Doc

Find A Doc is an open-source project aimed at creating a database of doctors that speak multiple languages in Japan. Foreign residents living in Japan sometimes find it difficult to communicate their medical needs in Japanese, or would feel more comfortable doing so in their native language. Find A Doc is an initiative to help connect residents with doctors that they can communicate more easily with.
